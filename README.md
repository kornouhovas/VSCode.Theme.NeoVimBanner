# NeoVimBanner (VS Code Theme)

Theme inspired by Neovim aesthetics: a muted navy background, soft contrast, and warm One Dark–style accents. The palette is tuned for long sessions with readable syntax highlighting, calm UI tones, and subtle focus states for the editor and sidebars.

## Description

NeoVimBanner emphasizes clean, “airy” readability: lines don’t blur together, and key elements are highlighted gently without harsh contrast. The interface stays calm while active elements remain visible, helping you keep focus on the code.
